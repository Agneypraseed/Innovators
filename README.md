# Problem Statement

## Create a more sustainable omnichannel experience <br>

Context : Global consumer product companies are seeing higher demand for “clean” products, and transparency around sustainability from production to delivery. Meanwhile, with the buying power shifting to Millennials and Gen Z, sustainability is rising as a differentiator for engagement and loyalty. It’'s now more important than ever for these companies to develop eco-friendly products, policies, and capabilities that safeguard our planet and our future. As these companies shift thinking to a digital business mindset, how can we bring sustainable capabilities to the forefront in their day-to-day digital operations? <br>

This scenario challenges you to build a solution to help grow and/or amplify digital sustainability practices within an omnichannel experience. <br>

Think about:<br>
How can introduce energy efficient or “greener” practices into technology strategy?
How can we help consumers navigate towards safer, more ethical options without greenwashing existing processes and products?
Which digital add-ons could you create to help brands build sustainability into a loyalty program—before, during, or after sales?
